# Cipher

This is a repository for a gui text cipher I've created in QT Creator.

It includes the algorithm for Caesar cipher using a text box for text input and spin box for shift input.

And in addition it includes a text encryption cipher I've thought about a few years ago although altered to use caesar shifting as the original didn't quite work as I hoped.
